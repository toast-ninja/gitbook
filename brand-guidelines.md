You may use the ToastE icon for purposes of creating your enterprise ToastE apps for Slack and GitHub Enterprise. You are required to set up your Toast app replicas as described in these docs for [GitHub](enterprise/github/display.md) and [Slack](enterprise/slack/display.md) to comply with our [Terms](terms.md).

Please refrain from using it for anything unrelated to Toast.

Please refrain from altering it in any way.

Feel free to use it for education or promotion of Toast \(e.g. sharing engineering best practices, blogs about engineering workflow, internal onboarding docs, etc.\).
