# Verification

### 1. Go to `{API_URL}/start` in your browser

e.g.: `http://192.0.0.168:10451/start`

ðŸ’¡ Note: If you configured a different port during [Host Setup](../host.md), you will use that port here instead.

You should see something like:

### 2. Troubleshooting

If the page shows Slack API error, then your host may not be connected to the internet \(it needs to be able to access `https://api.slack.com/`\). If that is not the case, then it's likely an issue with the Slack ENV variables setup. If you can't figure it out â€“ [contact us](../../support.md) and we will help!
