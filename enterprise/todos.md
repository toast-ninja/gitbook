# Todos

* ~~GitHub App / Capture Env Vars: Rea to finish page~~
* ~~Slack App: Anton to show Rea, and Rea to do page~~
* Deploy ToastE: Anton needs to fill in information here. Jesse provided a skeleton/stub.
* Finalize Configuration: Anton needs to give us these steps, nobody knows.
* ~~Do we need to protect our code with a license? \(~~[~~check github enterprise license~~](https://enterprise.github.com/license)~~\)~~
* Talk to the customer about pricing. Anton todo soon, we don't want to spring this on them and make them regret.
  * Why are we charging more for enterprise vs our normal hosted option?
    * In our experience cloud "on prem" deployments end up costing us a lot more time, energy, and money in terms of supporting these installations. 
    * We need to manage and maintain our deployable assets and documentation.
    * We need to maintain our private docker registry
    * Because of how slack manages its changes and permissions, we end up needing to stay on the bleeding edge of their changes in order to onboard new customers
    * Not all customers upgrade to the latest version at the same time, meaning that we are supporting many versions of our software at once, which increases the cost of support
    * All of these factors mean that we actually have much lower margins on ToastE vs Toast if we charged the same amount, even though we're no longer paying for the hardware.
* Rea: Go back through and change the slugs so they look nice.
* Rea: remove the Jesse :\(
* Remove this page
