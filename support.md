## [Request a ToastE kit ](https://forms.gle/YmAxTfwEARBSis2F8)
{% endhint %}

We now offer support through [Slack Connect bridges](https://slack.com/resources/using-slack/setting-up-a-shared-channel). Non-enterprise Toast users have access to Toast support right in Slack, and we didn't want our enterprise users to feel excluded. ðŸ™‚ Let us know if your team is interested in setting this up.

For more questions and technical support, contact us at **support@toast.ninja**.
