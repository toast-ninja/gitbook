# Terms & Conditions

{% hint style="info" %}
### **ToastE does not track or send your data to external sources.**
{% endhint %}

All of the following should be obvious but we still need to write them up.

* You may _not_ publish or redistribute our ToastE kit, source code, or registry access key.
* We retain all rights to ToastE and its source code. By paying for ToastE, you are paying for the temporary right to run and use the service on your own infrastructure. 
* If at any time you stop paying, your right to run ToastE is null and void. At that time, you must stop running ToastE, and after 30 days, if you haven't resumed payments, you must delete the ToastE images/files from your hardware.
* When you purchase ToastE, the contract will come with a user license limit. We will not put a hard stop on the usage of Toast, but we will review the usage monthly and communicate with the point of contact for the installation if the usage goes over the limits in order to discuss expansion of the license limit.
* ToastE does not store any sensitive information about your organization or intellectual property. It only stores metadata about relevant users and code. 
* ToastE does not send any information to external sources with the exception of Slack, and via that connection we are able to track app usage for product development research and contract compliance.
