# Use Toast

## Onboard

Finally, you can add Toast to your Slack workspace. Just navigate to:

`{API_URL}/slack`

e.g.: `http://192.0.0.168:10451/start`

Follow the link to connect Toast to your Slack, and then your GitHub Enterprise instance.   
  
After that, you can open DM in Slack with @toast, and proceed with adding users.

### All done! ðŸŽ‰
